ZapFS Enterprise License Agreement
Version 1.0 — © 2025 ZapFS

This ZapFS Enterprise License Agreement (“Agreement”) is between ZapFS, Inc.

By installing, accessing, or using the Enterprise Features, Licensee agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

1. Definitions
   "ZapFS" means the open-core distributed file system software distributed by Licensor under an open-source license.
   "Enterprise Features" means the proprietary, commercially-licensed components of ZapFS provided under this Agreement (e.g., erasure coding, multi-disk striping, hierarchical storage tiers, LDAP/SSO integration, quota enforcement, cross-node replication, advanced metrics, and other proprietary modules designated by Licensor).
   "License Key" means the signed, cryptographically verified key provided by Licensor to enable Enterprise Features.
   "Instance" means each running copy of ZapFS (per node, container, VM, or binary).

2. Grant of License
   Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:
   a. Install and use the Enterprise Features on the number of Instances covered by the purchased license.
   b. Use the Enterprise Features solely for internal business operations.
   This license does not permit redistribution, resale, hosting as a service, or sublicensing unless explicitly permitted by a separate agreement.
